/**
 * Created by hluu on 1/23/16.
 * <p>
 * Problem statement:
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that
 * lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
 * <p>
 * Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums
 * between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 * <p>
 * A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
 * Return 3.
 * The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
 * <p>
 * Approach:
 *   * Notice the numbers can be both positive and negative, so the sum will increase as well
 *     as decrease.
 *   * Can we solve this problem by iterating through the array once - O(n)?
 *   * As we iterate to a number
 *     1) If lower <= number + runningSum =< upper, then include that number in range
 *     2) If not, close that range if there was a range, start a new range
 *     3)
