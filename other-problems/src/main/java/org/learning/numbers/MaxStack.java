 * The MaxStack is a stack-like data structure that also allows stacklike access to the elements by their value
 * For example, given a stack of {1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 2}
 * peek() -> 2, peekMax() -> 5
 * pop() -> 2; peek() -> 5, peekMax() -> 5
 * pop() -> 5; peek() -> 4, peekMax() -> 5
 * push(6); peek() -> 6, peekMax() -> 6
 * popMax() -> 6; peek -> 4, peekMax() -> 5
 * popMax() -> 5; peek -> 4, peekMax() -> 4
