 * This problem pertains to the field of bioinformatics, but it does not require any specialized biological knowledge.
 * All DNA is composed of sequences of four "letters" of nucleotides, whose abbreviations are A, C, G, and T,
 * strung together, for example: "AAGATCCGTC".  A typical chromosome (a very long DNA molecule) may have several millions
 * of these letters strung together.  When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to know when a particular sequence of letters is repeated.
 * For this problem, we would like to identify all the 10-letter-long sequences that occur more than once in any given chromosome.
 * Write a program that prints out all such sequences to the standard output stream, sorted in alphabetical order.
 * Start with this code:
