 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integer and assume the number of element is odd.
 *
 * Figure out 5 different ways of find the median
 *
 * Traditional ways of finding a median:
 * 1) Sort, and get value at index = len(array)/2 + 1                  => O(nlog(n))
 * 2) Use a heap, dump all values in there and get out (len/2+1) times => O(nlog(n))
 * 3) Use quickselect                                                  => O(n^2)
 * 4)
 * 5)
