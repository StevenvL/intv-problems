 * Write a function to compute the maximum length palindromic sub-sequence of an array.
 * A palindrome is a sequence which is equal to its reverse.
 * A sub-sequence of an array is a sequence which can be constructed by removing
 * elements of the array.
 *
 * Ex: Given [4,1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] should return 10 (all 4's)
