 *
 * Problem statement:
 *  If X and Y are string, Z is a common subsequence of X and Y if it is
 *  a subsequence of both of them.
 *
 *  For example: X => CATCGA and Y => GTACCGTCA then Y => CTCA, CTGA
 *
 *  Substring is a subsequence of a string in which the chararacters must
 *  be drawn from contiguous positions in the string.
 *
 *  For a string with length n characters, it has (n^2) substrings
 *
 *  For a string with length n characters, it has (2^) subsequences
 *
